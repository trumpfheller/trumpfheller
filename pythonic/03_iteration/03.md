### Iteration

* Definition: a repetition of a process

* used for an indefinite number of iterations

* Loops are control structures for codeblock iteration
* Repeatedly execute codeblack when the expression is True

* Boolean expression determines the execution of a codeblock


### Iterating through an Iterable

### Iterable

* An object that can be iterated or repeatedly applied
* All sequences and containers are iterable
* Has items htat can be accessed.

### Iterable For Loops - Example

```python
# Define a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Iterate over each element in the list using a for loop
for num in numbers:
    print(num)
```

### Iterable While Loops - Example

```python
mylist = ['a','b','c']
# iterable mylist
i=0
# called index number

while i < len(mylist):
    ch = mylist[i]
    print(ch)
    i = i+1
```
