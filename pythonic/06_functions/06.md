[Python Style guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)

### The 3 steps of a function

1. input
2. transform
3. Output

you can do two things with functions

* Define it (a block of re-usable code => loop)
* call it

```python
# define the function
def do_nothing():
        # since functions do something, use a verb as function name
    pass

# call the function
do_nothing()
```

Syntax

```python
def <function_name>([<parameters>]):
    <statement(s)>
```

### Examples of functions

* len
* open
* reversed
* password_validator

### Programming interface

* Function caller (client) only needs to know about the inputs and output
  * Implementation details are hidden, how it does the processing is hidden from us (Like a black box)
* Because we don't know the implementation we can concentrate on higher level thingking - how modules work together, instead of how they work.

### Calling Functions

* function name and parenthesis and values (arguments within the parenthesis)
* number of arguments depends on the function's defintion

### Function implementation

* is ideally self contained.
* we will only change this part of code should we need to fix bugs or come up with a better algorithm
* we use parameters as part of the processing
* Returns an output

### Function Definition and Syntax

    Explain how to define a function using the def keyword.
    Discuss the function signature, including the function name, parameters, and return type.
    Cover the syntax for defining default parameter values, variable-length argument lists, and keyword arguments.

* Function signature (interface)
  * def key word
  * functiona name
  * Function parameters [variable names, zero or more]
* function body
  * intended codeblock, statements
  * can contain zero or more return statements

Function Parameters and Arguments:

    Differentiate between parameters and arguments.
    Discuss the various types of function parameters, such as positional, keyword, and default parameters.
    Explain how to pass arguments to functions and the different ways of doing so.

Return Values:

    Explain how functions can return values using the return statement.
    Discuss the importance of return values and how they can be used in function calls and expressions.

Scope and Lifetime of Variables:

    Introduce the concept of scope in Python and how it relates to functions.
    Discuss local and global variables and their visibility within functions.
    Explain variable lifetime and how it affects the availability of variables in different scopes.

Nested Functions and Closures:

    Introduce the concept of nested functions.
    Explain how nested functions can access variables from their enclosing scope.
    Discuss closures and their role in maintaining the state of a function across multiple calls.

Anonymous Functions (Lambda Functions):

    Introduce lambda functions and their syntax.
    Discuss their use cases and limitations compared to regular functions.

Function Decorators:

    Explain what decorators are and how they are used to modify the behavior of functions.
    Discuss common use cases for decorators and provide examples of built-in decorators like @staticmethod and @classmethod.

Recursion:

    Introduce the concept of recursion in Python.
    Discuss recursive functions, their structure, and how they solve problems by breaking them down into smaller, similar subproblems.

Best Practices and Tips:

    Provide best practices for writing clean, readable, and efficient functions.
    Discuss naming conventions, function length, and the single responsibility principle.
    Offer tips for debugging functions and handling errors gracefully.


### Readability counts docstring vs comments [Zen of Python]

> ***docstring*** describes the function's external behavior, and the parameters it takes.
> ***comments*** should document internal info about how the code works. 

* documentation to a function definition (page 152)

```python
def echo(anything):
    'echo returns its input argument'
    return anything
```
