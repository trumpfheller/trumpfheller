<h1>My QA Playbook</h1>
<h3>QA done right.</h3>

***

## Learning never stops. <br> Hence, a QA doc is a living doc.

### Epistemological QA Flow

My documentation is a screenshot, my back-up and a reference.
Because Information overload is not a myth. <br>
There are times when my brain is so caught up in the thinking of the details,
while having the bigger complexer picture in the back of my mind,
I loose either the bigger picture or a crucial detail.<br>
My therapist explained to me that I shouldn't waste time with
the guilt trip my backstabbing colleagues gave me (Look at him, he made a mistake!).
* Only who dares can make mistakes.
* Solutions require free thinking.

### Divide Et Impera
A computer has multiple instances in which information gets stored or processed. <br>
In psychology, I learned that the brain has short term, long term memory, muscle memory and so on.
To navigate/prevent information overload I simply divide load of information in:
<dl>
    <dd>knowledge that I can store (i.e GitHub)</dd>
    <dd>knowledge that is long term in my brain</dd>
    <dd>knowledge that is process in my short term memory</dd>
    <dd>knowledge that my finger muscle memorized by typing all day.</dd>  
</dl>

<blockquote>
I call the flow of information and experience that accumulated over time
to a knowledgebase - my 'Epistemological QA Flow'.
</blockquote>

### Learning for the new
QA documentation keeps onboarding civil.

### Learning for the everyday
1. The knowledge base grows because with every feature, with every update and optimization,
   QA learns new challenges and of course new skills.
2. Cognitively it is more efficient and therefore reasonable to outsource some knowledge in a living doc
   and keep the link to that doc in the brain's memory.
3. I know where to find the knowledge when I need it but for now I can forget
   and focus on the here and now.

### Learning in retro syllogism
Assumption#1: QA documentation instantiates each learning iteration. <br>
Assumption#2: Only in retro we can capture the instantiation. <br>
Conclusion: documentation is a epistemological flow.<br>

Documentation is in essence not only a description of the processes
but also a dependable source of knowledge about what worked and how - 
what I am justified to have confidence in.
Documentation becomes a flow of knowledge since the knowledge is
re-instantiated with each iteration.


## Take away
- Living doc is an aid to build my own QA knowledgebase.
- A compact reference in time of need.
- To ask for review (nobody needs to be perfect).
- Gathering information and experience to get me on the level where I generate new testing ideas.
