### Introduction

In my previous course (project management) I was working on an idea to convert ICE trucks to EV trucks. I noticed that the conversion idea itself took off but often with a polite hint of skepsis. The Skepsis as I found out later, was based on the fear of being stranded on the highway with a dead battery due to insufficient network of recharging stations. According to a Pew Research Center study, 53% of Americans have low levels of confidence that the US will build necessary EV infrastructure (survey conducted 05/30-06/04, 2023). 

So the question that I was trying to clarify for myself was: why would someone fear the lack of recharging opportunities when the range is comparable to an ICE?
Hence, the idea is to look if the capability to range actually suffices. To make it even more self evident I add the worse case scenario by looking at EVs that are bigger, heavier and therefore more vulnerable to being stranded on side of the road with an empty battery - SUV-EVs.
