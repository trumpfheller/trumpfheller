### Data Structure

**Lists**: 
- ordered collections of items and can store heterogeneous data types. 
- Lists are mutable, meaning you can add, remove, or modify elements in-place.

**Tuples**
- similar to lists but are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified once created. 
- They are commonly used to represent fixed collections of related data.

**Dictionaries**
- are key-value pairs and provide a way to store and retrieve data based on a unique key. They are also known as associative arrays or hash maps. Dictionaries are useful for mapping one value to another and are highly efficient for data retrieval.

**Sets**
- unordered collections of unique elements. 
- useful when you want to eliminate duplicate values or perform set operations such as union, intersection, or difference.

**Strings**
- Although not a traditional data structure, strings are fundamental in programming. 
- They are sequences of characters and provide methods for manipulating and working with textual data.
