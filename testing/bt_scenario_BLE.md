## Test scenario for BLE Connection and Data Exchange
> built a sustainable matrix

* Test Case: BLE Connection and Data Exchange
* Objective:
To verify that a BLE peripheral and BLE central device can connect successfully, exchange data reliably, and handle disconnections properly.

### Test Environment:
* Devices: One BLE peripheral (e.g., a BLE sensor or development board) and one BLE central (e.g., a smartphone or BLE development board).
* Software: BLE communication application or test tool for interaction with BLE services and characteristics.

## Test Steps:

### 1.Setup and Initialization:

* Prepare Devices: Ensure both BLE peripheral and BLE central devices are powered on and in a state where they can perform BLE operations.
* BLE Services and Characteristics: Configure the BLE peripheral with specific services and characteristics for testing (e.g., a heart rate service with a heart rate measurement characteristic).

### 2.Device Discovery:

* Start Scanning: On the BLE central device, start scanning for BLE devices.
* Verify Discovery: Confirm that the BLE peripheral is detected by the central device. The peripheral should be listed in the scan results with its advertised name or UUID.
> NOTE: these steps vary by device a lot. Example: Oculus has OTA, while Google Assitant and some wearables not necessarily utilize OTA.

### 3.Establish Connection:

* Initiate Connection: On the BLE central device, initiate a connection to the BLE peripheral.
* Verify Connection: Confirm that the connection is established successfully. The central device should show a connected status, and the peripheral should acknowledge the connection.

### 4.Data Exchange:

* Discover Services: On the central device, discover the services offered by the peripheral.
Discover Characteristics: Locate the characteristics associated with the discovered services.
* Read Characteristic: Perform a read operation on a characteristic (e.g., read the value of a temperature characteristic from the peripheral).
* Write Characteristic: Write a value to a characteristic (e.g., send a configuration value to the peripheral).
* Subscribe to Notifications/Indications: Subscribe to notifications or indications for a characteristic (e.g., subscribe to heart rate measurements).
* Verify Data Reception: Ensure that the central device receives notifications or indications as expected and that the data matches the expected format.

### 5.Connection Stability:

* Maintain Connection: Verify that the connection remains stable during data exchange, with no unexpected disconnections or errors.
* Test Connection Parameters: Optionally, test different connection parameters (e.g., connection interval, slave latency) to observe their impact on performance and stability.

### Interruption and Recovery:

* Simulate Interference: Introduce potential sources of interference (e.g., other BLE devices) and observe the impact on connection stability and data exchange.
* Disconnect and Reconnect: Disconnect the BLE central from the peripheral and then reconnect to ensure the connection can be reestablished correctly.

---

### Cleanup:

* Disconnect Devices: Properly disconnect both devices once testing is complete.
* Clear Logs: Ensure that any logging or monitoring data is archived or cleared.

### Expected Results:

* Successful Discovery: The BLE peripheral should be discoverable by the central device.
* Connection Established: The connection between the peripheral and central should be established without issues.
* Reliable Data Exchange: Data read and write operations should be performed successfully, and notifications/indications should be received as expected.
* Stable Connection: The connection should remain stable throughout the test, with minimal interference or disruptions.
* Correct Data Handling: The data exchanged should be accurate and consistent with expected values.

### Reporting:

* Document the results of the device discovery, connection status, data exchange operations, and connection stability.
* Include any issues encountered, such as failed connections or data discrepancies.
* For Agile - retro provide recommendations based on the findings, such as improvements needed for better performance or reliability.
