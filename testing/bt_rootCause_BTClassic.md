## Root Cause Analysis 
> for Bluetooth Classic (BR/EDR) Continuous Data Streaming Issues

Scenario: Testing the continuous data streaming functionality of a device using Bluetooth Classic (BR/EDR) and encounter problems => identify the root cause.

### 1. Problem Statement:
> Clearly define the problem you are experiencing.

Example: "Continuous data streaming over Bluetooth Classic fails intermittently after 5 minutes of operation."

### 2. Data Collection:
> Gather relevant information to understand the problem better.

* Symptoms:
  * What are the specific error messages or behaviors you observe?
  * Does the data stream completely stop or is it just fragmented/corrupted?
  * Does the connection drop altogether, or just the data stream?
  * Is there any specific pattern to the failures (e.g., time of day, specific data content)?

* Environment:
  * Which devices are involved (sender, receiver, any intermediary devices)?
  * What are their operating systems and firmware versions?
  * What is the distance between the devices?
  * Are there any other Bluetooth devices operating in the same vicinity?
  * What are the specific Bluetooth profiles and services used?
  * What is the data rate and packet size used for streaming?

* Logs:
  * Collect any relevant logs from the devices (bugreport).

### 3. Analysis:
> Analyze the collected data to narrow down the possible root causes.

* Data Stream Integrity:
  * Analyze the data received to identify any patterns or errors in the data stream.
* Connection Stability:
  * Examine the Bluetooth connection logs for any disconnections or connection issues.
  * Analyze network traces to identify connection establishment and termination events.
* Resource Constraints:
  * Check for any memory leaks, buffer overflows, or other resource issues on either device.
* Interference:
  * Analyze the network trace for any other Bluetooth devices interfering with the communication.
* Bluetooth Stack Issues:
  * Review the Bluetooth stack logs for any errors or warnings.

### 4. Root Cause Identification:
> identify the most likely root cause of the problem.

### Example Root Causes:

* Bluetooth Stack Issues:
  * Incorrectly configured Bluetooth stack parameters (e.g., data rate, buffer size).
  * Bugs in the Bluetooth stack implementation connection instability.
* Interference:
  * Other Bluetooth devices interfering with the communication.
* Hardware Issues:
  * Faulty Bluetooth transceiver on one of the devices.

### 5. Verification:
After implementing the solution, retest the data streaming functionality to verify that the issue has been resolved.
