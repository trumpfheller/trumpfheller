## Bluetooth profiles 
> and purposes

### Basic Bluetooth Concepts:
> difference between Bluetooth Classic and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

### 1. Classic Bluetooth (BR/EDR)
* The original Bluetooth technology - Basic Rate (BR) or Enhanced Data Rate (EDR).
* Purpose: Used for continuous data streaming (e.g., audio on Bluetooth headsets) and file transfer. It supports higher data rates and more power consumption compared to BLE.

### 2. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
* A subset of Bluetooth designed for low power consumption and lower data rates.
* Purpose: Ideal for applications requiring periodic data exchanges or long-term battery life, such as fitness trackers, medical devices, IoT, and smart home sensors.

### Bluetooth Audio (A2DP, HFP, HSP, etc.)
* Profile's specifically for audio communication.
* Purpose:
  * A2DP (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile): High-quality audio streaming (e.g., music).
  * HFP (Hands-Free Profile): Voice communication for hands-free calling.
  * HSP (Headset Profile): Basic audio communication for headsets.

### Bluetooth LE Audio
* A new standard, introduces features like Low Complexity Communication Codec (LC3) and Multi-Stream Audio.
* LC3 is designed to be a more efficient and flexible audio codec compared to its predecessors, providing better audio quality and improved energy efficiency.
* Purpose: Enhances audio quality and supports multiple audio streams, improving the experience for wireless headphones and hearing aids.
* features and functions:
  * Audio Quality: LC3 delivers high audio quality even at lower bitrates, which means you get clear sound without consuming excessive data. This makes it particularly useful for streaming audio over Bluetooth, where bandwidth and quality are critical.
  * Efficiency: It is designed to be more efficient in terms of power consumption, which helps extend battery life in Bluetooth devices like headphones, earbuds, and smartphones.

### Bluetooth Mesh Profiles (Lighting, Building Automation)
* Specific profiles within the Bluetooth Mesh framework for different applications.
  * A networking protocol that allows Bluetooth devices to form large-scale mesh networks.
* Purpose: Tailored for specific use cases like smart lighting or building automation, providing standardized ways to control and monitor devices within a mesh network.
  * Suitable for applications requiring extensive device communication across large areas, such as smart lighting systems and industrial automation. It extends BLEâ€™s reach by allowing devices to relay messages to other devices in the network.

Note: I never tested this but I am mentioning this to display the existing range.

### Bluetooth 4.0
* Explanation: Introduced BLE as part of the Bluetooth 4.0 specification.
* Purpose: Enhanced data rates for Classic Bluetooth and low power communication for BLE. Bluetooth 4.0 is backward compatible with earlier versions.

### Bluetooth 4.1
* Explanation: Improved upon Bluetooth 4.0 with better coexistence with LTE and enhanced BLE features.
* Purpose: Introduced features like improved data transfer, better connection management, and simultaneous connections for both Classic Bluetooth and BLE.

### Bluetooth 4.2
* Explanation: Added enhancements for privacy, security, and higher data transfer rates for BLE.
* Purpose: Introduced features like the Internet Protocol Support Profile (IPSP) for direct communication with the internet and improved data throughput.

### Bluetooth 5.0
* Explanation: A significant update from Bluetooth 4.2, offering improvements in range, speed, and broadcasting capacity.
* Purpose: Enhanced BLE with increased range (up to 240 meters), double the speed (2 Mbps), and greater capacity for broadcasting data. Suitable for applications requiring more bandwidth and longer range.

### Bluetooth 5.1
* Explanation: Introduced Angle of Arrival (AoA) and Angle of Departure (AoD) features for improved location tracking.
* Purpose: Enhances location services with better accuracy, suitable for indoor navigation and asset tracking.

### Bluetooth 5.2
* Explanation: Added features like Enhanced Attribute Protocol (EATT) and Isochronous Channels.
* Purpose: Improved performance for multiple simultaneous connections, low latency, and support for new use cases like audio sharing and better audio quality.
