## Tools - protocol analyzers

- gather information of wifi and network, decoding 1 an zeros to human readable protocols [transmission control protocol ]
- provides additional features => analystics

### 1. wireshark [protocol analyzers]
- packet analyzer
- panel 1: shows each frame as it goes through the ethernet/network,
  - click on one HTTP protocol that is ok
- panel 2: details about the frame I clicked in the previous panel
  - source IP and destination IP
  - Port numbers used in the TCP (Transmission Control Protcol)
- panel 3: shows the hexi decimal and ascii representation of what is inside the ethernet frame.

### 2. multimeters 
- to measure multiple parameters of an electric circuit like voltage, current, and resistance (voltmeter, ohmmeter, and ammeter).
- additional properties such as temperature and capacitance.
- 

### 3. logic Analyzers 
- 16 input channels
- always connect the ground (black cable)
- samples data
  - analog (continous changing values) are waves and digital wave forms are based on voltages (not waves)
  - transitor technology that has been used (TTL, CMOS, PECL, BICMOS, DTL)
