## Tools - protocol analyzers

- gather information of wifi and network, decoding 1 an zeros to human readable protocols [transmission control protocol ]
- provides additional features => analystics

### 1. wireshark [protocol analyzers]
- packet analyzer
- panel 1: shows each frame as it goes through the ethernet/network,
  - click on one HTTP protocol that is ok
- panel 2: details about the frame I clicked in the previous panel
  - source IP and destination IP
  - Port numbers used in the TCP (Transmission Control Protcol)
- panel 3: shows the hexi decimal and ascii representation of what is inside the ethernet frame.

### 2. multimeters 
- to measure multiple parameters of an electric circuit like voltage, current, and resistance (voltmeter, ohmmeter, and ammeter).
- additional properties such as temperature and capacitance.
- 

### 3. logic Analyzers 
- 16 input channels
- always connect the ground (black cable)
- samples data
  - analog (continous changing values) are waves and digital wave forms are based on voltages (not waves)
  - transitor technology that has been used (TTL, CMOS, PECL, BICMOS, DTL)

### Using sniffers in Bluetooth testing 

* involves monitoring and analyzing Bluetooth communication to troubleshoot issues, verify **compliance**, or ensure the correct operation of Bluetooth devices. 

Guide to help you get started:

1. Choose the Right Bluetooth Sniffer
* Hardware Sniffers: Dedicated devices designed for capturing Bluetooth signals. Examples include the Ellisys Bluetooth Tracker, Frontline Sodera, and the Bluefruit LE Sniffer by Adafruit.
* Software Sniffers: Software tools that can work with compatible Bluetooth hardware or virtual sniffers for specific use cases. Examples include the Bluetooth HCI Snoop Log on Android devices or Wireshark with Bluetooth support.

2. Set Up the Sniffer
* For Hardware Sniffers:
Connect the sniffer to your computer via USB or another interface.
Install the necessary drivers and software provided by the sniffer manufacturer.
Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for calibration and setup.
* For Software Sniffers:
Ensure your computer has the necessary Bluetooth adapter.
Install the sniffer software (e.g., Wireshark with Bluetooth plugin).
Configure the software to interface with your Bluetooth hardware.

3. Configure the Sniffer Software
* Select the Interface: Choose the Bluetooth adapter or sniffer hardware you are using.
Set the Channel or Frequency: Configure the sniffer to monitor specific Bluetooth channels or frequencies relevant to your testing.
Set Capture Filters (if applicable): Apply filters to focus on specific types of packets or devices.

4. Perform the Bluetooth Testing
Start Capturing: Begin the capture process on your sniffer software or hardware.
Generate Traffic: Perform actions with the Bluetooth devices you are testing, such as connecting, transmitting data, or performing specific operations.
Monitor the Traffic: Observe the captured data for any anomalies or issues.

5. Analyze the Captured Data
Review Packet Details: Examine the details of the captured Bluetooth packets, such as headers, payloads, and timing information.
Identify Issues: Look for any unexpected behavior, errors, or protocol violations.
Use Decoding Tools: Many sniffers come with built-in decoding tools to help interpret the captured data. For example, Wireshark can decode and display Bluetooth packets in a readable format.

6. Report Findings
Document Issues: Record any issues or anomalies found during the testing.
Provide Recommendations: Suggest solutions or improvements based on your findings.
Generate Reports: Use the sniffer software to generate detailed reports on the Bluetooth communication.

7. Fine-Tune and Retest
Adjust Settings: Modify capture settings, filters, or channels if necessary to focus on different aspects of Bluetooth communication.
Retest: Repeat the testing process to verify that issues have been resolved or to investigate further.
Additional Tips
Understand Bluetooth Protocols: Familiarize yourself with Bluetooth protocols (Classic Bluetooth, BLE) and their respective communication patterns.
Test in Different Environments: Perform testing in various environments to account for potential interference.
Stay Updated: Keep your sniffer software and firmware up to date to ensure compatibility and access to the latest features.
